- Follow Ruff and Ruff-format rules: All code must pass ruff and ruff-format as enforced by pre-commit.
- Always run `ruff format` before committing. Do not manually override formatting decisions made by automated tools.
- Docstrings: All public modules, classes, methods, and functions must have docstrings following the Google docstring style. Docstrings should include a summary, argument descriptions, return values, and exceptions raised (if any).
- Example (Google style):
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        \"\"\"Add two integers.

        Args:
            a: The first integer.
            b: The second integer.

        Returns:
            The sum of a and b.
        \"\"\"
- Line length: Max line length is 88 characters.
- No unused imports or variables: Remove any code flagged by Ruff as unused.
- Organize imports in the following order: standard library, third-party, local application imports.
- All public functions and methods must include complete type hints for arguments and return values.
